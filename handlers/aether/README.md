# ☁️ Aether: The Void

> *"The sky is not empty. It is the medium through which the light travels."*

**Aether** is the documentation and web retrieval engine of **UnaOS**. It rejects the "Browser" paradigm of the modern internet—a bloated, ad-ridden, tracking-heavy operating system within an operating system.

Instead, **Aether** is a precision instrument designed for one purpose: **The extraction of pure information.**

## 💠 The Philosophy: Signal over Noise

Modern web browsers are designed to capture your attention. **Aether** is designed to respect it.

### 1. The Reader First
Aether defaults to a "Reader Mode" state. It aggressively strips advertisements, trackers, and non-semantic layout elements. It presents the web as it was intended: **Hypertext**.
*   **Typography Engine:** Renders all content using the system's high-performance font stack.
*   **Zero-Distraction:** No pop-ups. No newsletter modals. Just the data.

### 2. The Offline Archive
Aether treats the local documentation (man pages, Rust docs, system manuals) and the remote web as a single continuum.
*   **Local First:** Search queries hit the local **Principia** manuals and **Gneiss** API docs before reaching out to the network.
*   **Snapshots:** Pages can be instantly frozen and stored in **Geode** archives for offline reference.

## ⚡ The Mechanics

### The Engine
Aether runs on a custom, lightweight layout engine written in Rust. It does not carry the weight of legacy Chromium.
*   **CSS Subset:** It supports the subset of CSS required for clean layout, ignoring bloatware features used for tracking.
*   **WASM Sandbox:** Scripts run in strict isolation, only when explicitly authorized by the user.

### The Link to Vein
Aether is the eyes for **Vein** (the AI).
*   When you ask Vein a question, Aether retrieves the source material.
*   Vein summarizes the content; Aether displays the citations.

## 🛑 The Kill List
Aether replaces:
*   **Google Chrome / Firefox** (for general browsing)
*   **Adobe Acrobat** (for PDF/Manual reading)
*   **Dash / Zeal** (for offline API docs)
*   **macOS Help Viewer**
