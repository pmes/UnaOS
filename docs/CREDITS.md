## The Giants
*We stand on the shoulders of:*

### The Visionaries
* **Steve Sakoman:** For the Newton, the BeBox, and for fathering the mobile computing era.
* **Joseph Palmer:** For the **BeBox** hardware and the spirit of the "GeekPort."
* **Steve Wozniak:** For proving that engineering is an art form.

### The Architects
* **Dominic Giampaolo (Be):** For **BFS** (The Be File System)—the database that acts like a disk.
* **Robert Watson (FreeBSD):** For **TrustedBSD** and the MAC Framework—the gold standard of OS security.
