## Current state (2026-07-02)

### aarch64 (branch `hw-pi4`) — the pioneer

- **M6a-0** — the kernel dropped from EL2 to **EL1** (EL2 residency was an
  accident of UEFI handoff; an EL0 SVC with `HCR_EL2.TGE=0` is taken to EL1,
  so EL1 is where the kernel must live). Fresh `TCR_EL1`/`SCTLR_EL1` setup;
  UEFI/QEMU-virt builds still enter at EL2.
- **M6a** — first EL0 round-trip: a scheduled task `eret`s to EL0, the user
  routine invokes `svc #0` with a Linux-style ABI (syscall number in `x8`,
  args `x0..x5`), handled at `VBAR_EL1 + 0x400`. Syscalls: `SYS_WRITE = 1`,
  `SYS_EXIT = 2`. User code copied to its page with the
  `DC CVAU` / `IC IVAU` cache-maintenance sequence. Metal-confirmed
  (2026-07-01): `hello from EL0` on the real Pi 4.
- **M6b** — per-page permissions + fault→task-kill: L2→L3 demotion to 4 KiB
  pages for a 16 KiB identity-mapped user window (code EL0-RX/EL1-RO via the
  kernel's first live PTE update + broadcast `tlbi vaae1is`; data/stack
  EL0-RW with UXN+PXN). EL0 synchronous faults kill the offending task via
  the scheduler — with `(task, EC, FAR)`-matched accounting and a
  cross-core verdict — instead of halting the kernel. Metal-confirmed
  (2026-07-01), including the stale-TLB case QEMU cannot test.
- Not yet: loadable programs (M6c), per-task address spaces/ASIDs (M6d),
  preemptible EL0 (M6e), validated user pointers (M6f).

### x86_64 (branch `hw-rmbp`)

- **U1a** — first ring-3 round-trip (the x86 mirror of aarch64 M6a). A
  scheduled task drops to **ring 3** via `iretq` (`sched::spawn_user` /
  `user_task_trampoline`), runs an embedded position-independent blob that does
  `sys_write("hello from ring 3\n")` then `sys_exit(0)` via **SYSCALL/SYSRET**,
  and the scheduler reclaims it. Syscall ABI mirrors aarch64: number in `rax`
  (`SYS_WRITE = 1`, `SYS_EXIT = 2`), args `rdi, rsi, rdx`, return in `rax`.
  Hardening landed with it: **EFER.NXE**, **NX** on the user data/stack pages,
  W^X on the user code page (mapped ring3-RX, kernel drops WRITABLE before first
  entry), **CR4.SMEP** (CPUID-gated — set on Ivy Bridge metal; TCG `qemu64`
  lacks it, logged), and **TSS.RSP0** so a ring-3 fault lands on a kernel stack
  instead of triple-faulting. QEMU-verified (2026-07-02: `hello from ring 3` +
  `U1a … PASS`, no faults, full boot/SMP/USB regression intact); metal pending.
- x86-specific shape (adapted from the aarch64 reference, which assumes infra
  x86 lacks): the SYSCALL stack-switch anchors are folded into `PerCpuData`
  (reached via `IA32_GS_BASE`; `KERNEL_GS_BASE` holds that pointer while ring 3
  runs, restored by the entry `swapgs`) rather than a separate struct — the
  scheduler's `this_cpu()` dependency requires GS to stay `&PerCpuData` in the
  handler. The 4 KiB user window at `USER_BASE = 1 TiB` (fresh `PML4[2]`) is
  built by a minimal mapper (`memory.rs`: `translate` + `map_user_page`) over
  the firmware identity map — there is no `OffsetPageTable`; `CR0.WP` is toggled
  around the entry writes (the firmware maps its page tables read-only).
- Not yet (arc U1b): user fault → task kill (today a ring-3 fault is fatal but
  lands cleanly on RSP0), full user-GPR preservation across a syscall,
  validated user pointers (`copy_from_user`).

## The chain

| Arc | x86_64 (lead) | aarch64 (port) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Privilege round-trip | U1a ✅ | M6a ✅ |
| Per-page perms + fault→kill | U1b | M6b ✅ |
| Loadable programs | U2 (from FAT storage) | M6c (embedded blob) |
| Per-process address space | U3 (per-process PML4/CR3) | M6d (TTBR0 + ASID) |
| Process model, PIDs, handle table | U4 (arch-neutral) | U4 |
| Capabilities at the syscall boundary | U5 (arch-neutral) | U5 |
| FS-backed grants | U6 (UnaFS attributes) | U6 |

Conventions shared across arches:

- **Syscall numbering is common** (`SYS_WRITE = 1`, `SYS_EXIT = 2`, …);
  register conventions per-arch (aarch64: `x8`/`x0..x5`; x86_64:
  `rax`/`rdi,rsi,rdx,r10,r8,r9`).
- **User faults kill the task, kernel faults stay fatal.** Fault accounting
  is matched (task, vector/EC, address) so demos assert exact outcomes.
- **User pages are never executable-and-writable**; code pages are read-only
  to the kernel after load.
