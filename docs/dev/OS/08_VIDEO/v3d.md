# Pi 4 GPU — VideoCore VI (V3D 4.2)

The Raspberry Pi 4's GPU is a Broadcom **VideoCore VI** with a **V3D 4.2** render
core. The driver is `arch/aarch64/v3d.rs` behind the `v3d` cargo feature
(`UNAOS_V3D=1`, implies `baremetal` ⇒ `pi`). Bring-up — firmware power domain,
clock gate, PM/ASB bridge release, the V3D-private MMU, and the M1–M4 milestone
chain (identity/probe → MMU → clear-job → first triangle) — is documented in
[`arch_arm64.md` §PI-V3D](../01_BOOT_HAL/arch_arm64.md). The M3 clear-job produced
the **first GPU-rendered, CPU-verified pixels on Pi silicon** (boot-P4).

This document records the **V3D 4.2 hardware contract facts** proven during the
R23s1f campaign while chasing the empty-bin defect: everything the coordinate
(binning) shader and the bin control list must get exactly right for the Primitive
Tile Binner (PTB) to emit tile lists. QEMU `raspi4b` models no V3D block (returns
at `BLOCK-DOWN`), so **every fact below was settled on metal**, not in emulation.

---

## 1. The bin control list requires fixed-function clip/viewport state (V3D-17)

The binner binned nothing because `build_bin_cl` emitted geometry with the hardware
clipper at **power-on-reset zeros**: the viewport scale collapsed every primitive to
a point, so the binner produced an empty-but-legal bin (the tile-alloc pool was never
written). The fix (PI-V3D-17, `ed333556`) emits five state packets after
`START_TILE_BINNING` and before `VCM_CACHE_SIZE`, every opcode/length/field bit
transcribed **verbatim** from Mesa `v3d_packet.xml` (gen 4.2) and the transform
values from Mesa's own `v3dX(emit)` fixed-function viewport code:

| Packet (opcode) | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CFG_BITS` (96, v42) | forward + reverse facing (no cull) |
| `CLIP_WINDOW` (107) | 0, 0, 64, 64 |
| `VIEWPORT_OFFSET` (108) | centre (32, 32); fine u14.8 = 8192 |
| `CLIPPER_XY_SCALING` (110, v42) | half-extent 32 px → `8192.0f32` |
| `CLIPPER_Z_SCALE_AND_OFFSET` (111) | scale 0.5, offset 0.5 (NDC[-1,1] → [0,1]) |

State was correct after this arc, but boot-P17 still binned empty (CL 71 B consumed
clean, pool + tile-STATE still zero) — pointing the investigation at the shader's VPM
output, not the fixed-function state.

---

## 2. The coordinate-shader VPM output contract is SIX words (V3D-18/19)

Mesa's coordinate (bin) shader output contract for V3D 4.2 is **six words per
vertex**, not four:

| VPM offset | Word | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0..3 | clip `Xc, Yc, Zc, Wc` | the vec4 clip-space position |
| 4 | screen `Xs` | `f2i32(floor(Xc · 8192 / Wc))` |
| 5 | screen `Ys` | `f2i32(floor(Yc · 8192 / Wc))` |

The screen words are what the **PTB actually bins from**. `8192` = viewport
half-extent 32 · clipper XY granularity 256; `floor` is the `devinfo` `ver == 42`
branch. Screen coords are **12.4 fixed-point** (centre-relative). Our `CS_VS_WORDS`
was a 4-word passthrough that wrote only offsets 0..3 and never 4, 5, so the PTB read
zero screen coords and binned an empty-but-legal list.

- **V3D-18 (`d15f3e6c`)** was the audit that proved this against Mesa
  (`v3d_nir_lower_io.c`, `v3d_uniforms.c`, `v3d_device_info.c` ver 42,
  `v3d_packet.xml` GL Shader State Record max_ver 42) and added the witness dumping
  the 52 shader-state-record bytes + the contracted 6-word vs our 4-word emit.
- **V3D-19 (`412479ae`)** widened `CS_VS_WORDS` to emit the two screen words
  (`fmul → ffloor → ftoiz → mov vpm` at out-offsets 4, 5). Expected centre-relative
  screen coords for the test triangle: v0(-0.6,-0.6) → Xs=-4916 Ys=-4916; v1(0.6,-0.6)
  → Xs=4915 Ys=-4916; v2(0,0.6) → Xs=0 Ys=4915.
- **W = 1 simplification (loud):** the test geometry all carries `Wc = 1.0`, so
  `1/Wc = 1.0` and **no reciprocal instruction is emitted** — the transform collapses
  to `floor(coord · 8192)`. This holds **only for W = 1 geometry**; perspective
  vertices need the reciprocal.
- **VPM segment sizes are unchanged:** Mesa packs them in **sectors** =
  `align(words, 8) / 8`, so both 4-in and 6-out round to 1 sector. The `1` in the
  shader-state record was always correct; the count was never the bug (see §3).

Boot-P19 (V3D-19 aboard): pool still zero — the *count* was right but the addressing
*mechanism* was still wrong (§3).

---

## 3. On V3D 4.x, VPM output is STVPMV — NOT streamed `mov vpm` (V3D-20) ⚠

**This is the 3.3-vs-4.2 trap, and it is loud.** Widening the word count (§2) never
moved the pool because the VPM addressing **form** was wrong, not the count.

The prior shader wrote its VPM output with the **streamed VC4 / V3D-3.3** mechanism:
a `vpmsetup` to arm a VPM segment, then `mov vpm, rfN` (magic waddr VPM = 14)
auto-advancing an implicit pointer. **That path does not exist for per-vertex shader
output on V3D 4.2.** Mesa's compiler (`nir_to_vir.c` `vir_VPM_WRITE`) emits exactly
one `vir_STVPMV(c, vir_uniform_ui(c, vpm_index), val)` per output component — a
store-VPM with an **explicit integer offset** — and never `mov vpm` / `vpmsetup` in
the ver-42 VS/CS output path.

So every prior `mov vpm` (the four clip words *and* the V3D-19 screen words) wrote an
**unconfigured magic register**; the PTB read zero screen coords and binned an
empty-but-legal list. No 4→6 word-count change ever moved it because the addressing
form was wrong all along.

The fix (PI-V3D-20, `597d7ed0`): `CS_VS_WORDS` stores all six words via `STVPMV` at
explicit VPM offsets 0..5 (offsets sourced as uniforms into rf9..rf14, Mesa-faithful);
`vpmsetup` is dropped (unused on 4.x VS/CS output); `VPMWT` stays (GFXH-1684 flush).
The input side (`ldvpmv_in`) and the Xs/Ys math are the validated V3D-19 body carried
verbatim.

> The VPM output is **on-chip** and not CPU/DRAM-readable on 4.x (there is no
> `V3D_VPM` CPU window; Mesa reads VPM back only via `LDVPM` in-shader). So the
> decisive metal verdict stays "tile-alloc pool / tile-STATE go non-zero," not a VPM
> readback. Boot-P20: pool **still** zero — which set up the last unproven link (§4).

## 4. Proving QPU execution via performance counters (V3D-21)

After V3D-17/18/20 verified every CPU→GPU hand-off correct (clip state, 6-word
STVPMV output, all Mesa-packed) yet the tile-alloc pool / tile-STATE stayed all-zero
with the CL consumed clean and no MMU fault, the **one unproven link was QPU
execution itself**. The technique that settled it **without perturbing the shader**
(PI-V3D-21, `6471eb9b`): hardware **performance counters (PCTR)**.

Three counters are armed immediately before the bin GO and read once the bin idles:

| Counter | Source id | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `QPU_ACTIVE_CYCLES_VERTEX_COORD_USER` | 14 | **the decisive witness** — ticks only while the QPU runs a vertex/coord user shader |
| `QPU_CYCLES_VALID_INSTR` | 16 | valid-instruction cycles |
| `CYCLE_COUNT` | 32 | total cycles (cross-check for the src↔id mapping) |

Register offsets + the SRC/EN/CLR/OVERFLOW/PCTRx programming sequence are the verbatim
Linux `v3d_regs.h` (V4 variant) + `v3d_perfmon.c` idiom; source ids are the
`enum v3d_perfcnt` index from uapi `v3d_drm.h` (ver < 71: index == hw source id,
cross-checked via `CYCLE_COUNT` = 32). A nonzero src 14 ⇒ the coordinate shader ran.

A TMU general-store witness was **rejected**: it adds QPU words (fabricated-constant
risk, §5) and makes a null result ambiguous (cannot separate "QPU never ran" from
"store mis-encoded") — the exact question the arc had to answer. PCTR is read-only
w.r.t. the shader.

**Verdict (boot-P21): SHADER RAN.** `src14 = 28`, `valid_instr = 53`. Four arcs of
ambiguity are dead: the coordinate shader executes, and the empty-bin fault is now
provably **PTB-side**.

---

## 5. The in-tree QPU packer workflow (fabricated-constant law)

**Every QPU instruction word committed to `v3d.rs` must be Mesa-packed**, never
hand-authored. The file carries **three prior convictions** for guessed register
constants; the standing law is that new words are produced by Mesa's own
`v3d_qpu_instr_pack` (ver 42) and round-tripped through unpack + repack.

The tooling lives **in-tree** at `scripts/pi-v3d*-qpu-gen.c` (one generator per arc:
`pi-v3d9-qpu-gen.c`, `pi-v3d19-qpu-gen.c`, `pi-v3d20-qpu-gen.c`, …), each built
against a fresh Mesa checkout. The retired PI-V3D-9 packer was **not gone**
(never-trash-code): it lives at `scripts/pi-v3d9-qpu-gen.c`, reproduces every
committed `CS_VS_WORDS` / `FS_WORDS` word bit-exactly, and passes the `qpu_disasm`
self-test — validating the encoder before any new words are trusted. Disassembly +
words for each arc are checked in alongside (e.g. `scripts/pi-v3d19-qpu-gen.out.txt`).

This is why the campaign could rule out "our shader words are wrong" as a hypothesis
class: the words are Mesa's own bytes, generated and self-tested, not fabricated.

## 6. The open wall — PTB bins nothing with the shader proven running

As of BUILD-SHA-1 (`2b330f57`), the graphics pipeline stands at a **narrowed but
open** defect. The evidence chain, each link machine-witnessed on metal:

1. **Fixed-function clip/viewport state is correct** — Mesa-verbatim packets emitted
   (V3D-17); yet pool zero.
2. **The VPM output count is correct** — 6 words, screen coords included (V3D-18/19);
   yet pool zero.
3. **The VPM output mechanism is correct** — STVPMV with explicit offsets, not the
   3.3-era streamed `mov vpm` (V3D-20); yet pool zero.
4. **The coordinate shader provably executes** — PCTR src14 = 28 (V3D-21).
5. **The bin job is not faulting** — the M4 MMU fault was proven *stale* (latched at
   `program_mmu`/M3, cleared pre-bin by V3D-15, `0667eef7`); with the pre-bin latch
   clear the bin idles with `MMU_fault = 0x0`. Pool zero + no fault = **legal idle**.

So the CL is consumed clean, the shader runs, nothing faults, and the **PTB still
emits no tile lists**. Every CPU→GPU hand-off is exonerated. The remaining candidates
are PTB-side / geometry-side:

- **Degenerate or fully-clipped geometry** — the shader runs but the transformed
  triangle bins to nothing (CL content / vertex data audit vs Mesa emit order;
  V3D-15's `dump_cl_bytes` is aboard for exactly this read).
- A PTB configuration or primitive-mode packet the bin CL still omits between the
  state packets (§1) and the draw.

The next V3D arc starts from a proven-executing shader and a fault-free, legally-idle
binner — the narrowest the empty-bin wall has ever been.

## 7. Replaying the visible battery (PI-APP-1)

The `v3d` shell command (PI-APP-1, `1e8e7a0f`) re-runs the four **visible** V3D
battery stages (M5 gradient, M6 animate, M7 multiprim, M8 blit — see
[`arch_arm64.md` §PI-V3D-11](../01_BOOT_HAL/arch_arm64.md)) on the live framebuffer
on demand, so the graphics are watchable while the system is up (the boot-time
battery flashes past before the monitor wakes). Re-entry reuses the state boot
established (power/clock/PM-ASB/MMU stay enabled, the arena stays identity-mapped)
and only re-kicks the per-stage jobs; a one-shot `V3D_REPLAY_READY` flag gates it, so
when the block never came up this boot (QEMU `BLOCK-DOWN` / any fail-closed verdict)
the app prints `stages=0` and touches no MMIO.
