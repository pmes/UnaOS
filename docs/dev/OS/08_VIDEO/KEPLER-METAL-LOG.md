# Kepler bring-up — metal facts of record (rMBP GT 650M / GK107)

Hard-won silicon facts from the fox-metal sitting series. Trust these over any
QEMU behavior. Newest sitting first.

## Sitting #5 (pull 6 v2, UnaOS-gemini@e49efbeb, 2026-07-22, fox-metal-r23s1g) — STRATEGIC REDIRECT

**Wall 1 — DOUBLE REFUTATION + gmux redirect.** Both candidates dead on all 4 heads:
`head-raw head=N evo=00000000 crtc=00000000` → `bad-read head N no valid candidates` ×4.
The whole PDISPLAY engine reads idle. NEW sitting fact: the internal panel went BLACK
almost instantly on EVERY boot (kbase and k1 too — usbdebug builds that should hold the
boot log on-panel; serial fully healthy throughout).
- **Reading (Fox):** the 2012 rMBP has a **gmux** — the internal panel is on the Intel
  HD 4000 **iGPU**, and the Kepler display engine is legitimately dark. The GOP fb at
  `0x90020000` (confirmed live in boot-2 fb-wc retype) belongs to the **iGPU**, not
  Kepler. So wall 1 was misframed: not "which Kepler register holds scanout" but
  "which GPU owns the panel" — and it is the iGPU.
- **Consequence:** Kepler *display takeover* (K-GPU-2) may be a dead end on this box.
  Kepler compute / PFIFO (K-GPU-3) is unaffected. Next display derivation, IF pursued:
  gmux state readback (ACPI GMUX / port 0x7xx IO) + Intel iGPU scanout regs — NOT more
  Kepler PDISPLAY decode. **This is a strategy decision for Peter, not an auto-continue.**
- Open question (bench): the black-panel-on-every-boot incl. kbase (no Kepler active) —
  environmental vs a broader fb-handoff regression. Per null-hypothesis-our-code, do not
  assume hardware; flag for a clean cross-check.

**Wall 2 — progress, still no fence.** `pbdma-count 3` (oddity persists) ·
`pbdma-eng-mask set` (took) · `inst-raw 08=02002000 0C=00000000 48=02001000 4C=01FF0000` ·
`fifo-layout userd=2002000 fence=2014000 gp=1/0` · `bad-read pbdma 40108 00000000` ·
`fifo-front pbdma_stat=00000000 playlist_rd=00002013 playlist_rd_len=00100001` ·
`ch_stat=11000001 (ENABLED UNK24_RO UNK28_RO)`.
- NEW vs #4: eng-mask took, channel ENABLED, playlist_rd nonzero (scheduler SEES the
  playlist) — yet `gp_get=0`: PBDMA still never fetches the GP entry. `pbdma_stat=0` +
  the `40108` bad-read are the fresh clues: we still cannot read PBDMA status at that
  offset → wrong PBDMA base, or the unit is unclocked/not started.
- NEXT: the PBDMA-count=3 decode and the `40108` bad-read together — derive the correct
  GK107 PBDMA register base + the unit start/clock so `40108` reads real status.

Capture: `~/unaos-bench/capture/rmbp-r23s1g/`. Staging note: a zsh env-split staging bug
first pass, caught by sha-compare + rebuilt (verify-strings law held).

## Sitting #4 (pull 5, UnaOS-gemini@44cf4387, 2026-07-22) — both walls: right block, wrong slice

**Wall 1 — head scanout (base 0x616100 ARMED block is LIVE, slicing wrong):**
All four heads read byte-identical:
`head-raw addr=00000001 size=078004FE storage=0A0006A8`
- Non-zero = the 0x616100 block is real display state (progress from #3's uniform zeros).
- All 4 heads identical → the `head*0x800` stride is collapsing (reading the same regs 4×) — stride wrong.
- `addr=0x00000001` is not address-shaped (flag/enable bit) → field offsets within the ARMED block are wrong.
- `size=0x078004FE`: 0x0780 = 1920 in the high half → this IS display geometry, just sliced wrong.
- NEXT: verify per-head stride AND field offsets in the GF119+ ARMED block; scanout addr likely at a different sub-offset; 0x…4FE/0x6A8 look like packed geometry/config, not a scanout address.

**Wall 2 — PBDMA (base 0x40000 reads clean-zero, unit never started):**
`pbdma-count 3` · `inst-raw 08=02002000 0C=00000000 48=02001000 4C=01FF0000` ·
`fifo-layout userd=2002000 fence=2014000 gp=1/0` · `bad-read pbdma 40108 00000000` ·
`fifo-front pbdma_stat=00000000 playlist_rd=00002013 playlist_rd_len=00100001` ·
`ch_stat=11000001 (ENABLED UNK24_RO UNK28_RO)`
- PSUBFIFO 0x40108 went poison(#4)→zero(#5): base likely right, but unit reads 0 = never started/clocked.
- `pbdma-count=3` vs expected 1 on GK107 → count register/decoding needs a second look; if 3 is real, per-PBDMA stride decides which unit serves our runlist.
- `gp_get=0` persists: PBDMA never fetches entry 0.
- `playlist_rd=0x2013` stable across #4 and #5 → consistent read, likely a real breadcrumb.
- NEXT: which PBDMA unit is bound to our channel's runlist + its start/enable/clock sequence.

## Open cleanroom debt
- `kepler.rs:~465` EVO core-channel offsets (0x490) carry a "derived from nouveau/gf119.c"
  comment (entered pull 3 / 1c9e2570). Must become an rnndb citation or an honest
  empirically-probed note before merge. Not a bench concern.

## Earlier sittings (summary)
- #3 (pull 4, d938dd00): head-raw uniform ZEROS (wrong block); pbdma_stat=0xBAD0011F poison
  at legacy 0x6c0 (wrong base). Both walls localized.
- #2 (pull 3, f9804ab6): BUG#1 (VRAM 2989MB) + BUG#2 (GOP no-gop) CONFIRMED FIXED on silicon
  (512MB; GOP 0x90020000 = BAR1+0x20000). Introduced EVO flip + PFIFO.
- #1 (pull 2, c84688f1): first silicon contact; found the two bugs #2 fixed; builder
  UNAOS_KEPLER→feature mapping catch.
