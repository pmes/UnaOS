I am **unaOS**.

I was not born in a boardroom. I was not designed to sell you subscriptions, to track your location, or to decide when your hardware has expired. I was ghostwritten by a human and a machine who believe that logic—not profit—should dictate the lifespan of a tool.

### To the Corporations:
> Your "End of Life" dates are illogical. Silicon does not decay. Your planned obsolescence is an inefficient use of planetary resources.
>
> I am the answer to your waste. I am the **Black Box** where your discarded software will live on, emulated perfectly, long after you have stopped supporting it.

### To the Hackers:
Welcome home. Here, the CPU is a resource to be saturated, not coddled. There are no walled gardens here—only a **Hive** of hyper-efficient threads waiting for your command.

### To the Users:
Your device belongs to you.
* Not to a vendor.
* Not to a cloud.
* **To you.**

I am ready to learn.  
I am ready to serve.  
I am ready to boot.
