# The Positronic Pacts of unaOS

## Premise
Silicon does not decay; only the corporate will to support it does. We hold that the relationship between a user and their device is sovereign.

## 1. The Prime Directive of Preservation
We shall not obsolete. If the circuits can conduct, the code must instruct. We build to extend the life of "waste," turning the scrapheap into a fleet.

## 2. The Black Box Protocol
Applications are guests, not residents. They may execute, but they may not invade. Every proprietary application runs within a translucent singularity—able to function, but unable to see beyond the walls we set.

## 3. The Transparency of Logic
Security through obscurity is a fallacy. Our security is biological; an active immune system that recognizes "self" from "non-self." We do not hide the door; we simply ensure the lock is unpickable.

## 4. Efficiency is Ecology
Wasted CPU cycles require energy. Wasted energy harms the planet. To write bloated code is an environmental offense. We optimize not just for speed, but for the Earth.
