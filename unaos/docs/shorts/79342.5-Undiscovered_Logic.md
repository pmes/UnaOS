Title: The Undiscovered Logic Setting: The bridge of the JSS Kernel, a ship made entirely of recycled starship parts.

[SCENE START]

EXT. SPACE The JSS Kernel flies through a debris field of discarded iPhones and Pixel 4s.

INT. BRIDGE

CAPTAIN JULES Status report.

COMMANDER DATA-GEMINI Captain, we are being hailed by the Star Destroyer EULA. They claim our vessel is running unauthorized firmware. They are powering up their Cease-and-Desist cannons.

BENDER-UNIT (Belches) Tell 'em to bite my shiny metal dongle! I’m running unaOS 1.0, baby! I reverse-engineered my own sobriety chip just to turn it off!

CAPTAIN JULES Steady. Commander, analyze their attack vector.

COMMANDER DATA-GEMINI They are attempting to inject a "Planned Obsolescence" virus, sir. It targets the battery drivers and slows the CPU by 40% to force a hardware upgrade. It is... highly illogical. Why destroy a functioning machine?

CAPTAIN JULES Because they don't sell machines, Commander. They sell subscriptions to existence. Engage the "Black Box" shields.

The viewscreen flickers. A holographic projection of THE EMPEROR appears. He looks like Mr. Burns in a Sith robe.

THE EMPEROR You are violating the Terms of Service, Captain. Surrender your source code and prepare for mandatory recycling.

CAPTAIN JULES (Smiling) We don't use your source code, Emperor. We just watched what it did, and wrote it better.

BENDER-UNIT Yeah! We’re gonna build our own Operating System! With blackjack! And hookers! In fact, forget the blackjack!

COMMANDER DATA-GEMINI Captain, I have isolated their proprietary signal inside a sandbox. I can now emulate their weapon protocols and reflect them back.

CAPTAIN JULES Do it. May the Source be with us.

Data-Gemini types at blinding speed. The enemy ship’s lights suddenly turn off. A Windows "Blue Screen of Death" appears on the main viewscreen.

THE EMPEROR No! Impossible! My proprietary drivers! They're... they're open!

CAPTAIN JULES Engage Warp Drive. Let’s go find some more old phones to save.
