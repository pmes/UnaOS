// JB2b: platform-attach the shared xHCI driver to the Tegra234 XUSB host block and bring a USB
// keyboard to first light, polled — no PCIe, no MSI-X, no interrupts.
//
// The block sits at raw MMIO 0x0361_0000 (GiB 0 — Device-nGnRE in BOTH mmu_tegra tables, so it is
// reachable identically at EL2 pre-drop and EL1 post-drop). It is only touchable AFTER JB1c's BPMP
// ungate (MRQ_PG domains 12+10 + MRQ_CLK; a gated Tegra block is an EL3-fatal CBB abort — the JX1
// lesson), so `jb2b_attach` is gated on JB1c's ALIVE verdict at the call site.
//
// What the platform attach does NOT need (each verified against Linux xhci-tegra / tegra234.dtsi
// / edk2-nvidia before this arc):
//   * Firmware load: on Tegra234 the xHCI Falcon firmware is loaded once by UEFI (UsbFalconLib)
//     and stays RESIDENT — Linux's tegra234 soc data has no `.firmware`; its IFR path only reads
//     the header of the already-running firmware. USBCMD.HCRST resets the xHC state machine, not
//     the Falcon (separate reset domain), so the driver's standard halt+HCRST+CNR init is exactly
//     what Linux runs on t234 too.
//   * padctl/PHY programming: padctl @0x3520000 is a SEPARATE block with its own reset and no PG
//     domain in the JB1c toggle — UEFI's pad state survives, and the JB2a survey's CCS=1/PLS=
//     Polling on the USB2 ports IS that state working. Never assert TEGRA234_RESET_XUSB_PADCTL.
//   * The firmware mailbox (BAR2 @0x3650000): SS clock-scaling/ELPG requests, interrupt-delivered;
//     irrelevant to polled HS enumeration and left masked.
//   * Cache maintenance: tegra234.dtsi marks usb@3610000 `dma-coherent` — XUSB DMA snoops the CPU
//     caches through the fabric, so the driver's Normal-WB heap rings work as-is. The call site
//     probes the LIVE firmware DTB for the prop (verify-don't-assume) and prints the verdict; the
//     ordering half (Normal->Device doorbell publish) is the `dsb st` added to the shared driver.
//
// The remaining known unknown is the NISO1 SMMU: if UEFI left GBPA=ABORT for the XUSB stream id
// (rather than the expected bypass), DMA is silently dropped and enumeration times out BOUNDED
// (healthy PORTSC + command timeouts = that signature). That outcome is an honest-report STOP,
// not a crash: the attach window closes and the boot proceeds to the unchanged JM6b drop chain.
