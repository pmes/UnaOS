// aarch64 EL0 userspace + the SVC syscall interface (M6a: the first privilege boundary; M6b: fault
// isolation + per-page user permissions; M6c: the well-behaved `hello` program moved OUT of kernel
// `.text` into a separately linked, baked-in flat blob — `USER_BLOB` below).
//
// The kernel runs at EL1 (see boot::drop_to_el1). A user task drops to EL0 (sched::spawn_user) and
// calls back in with `svc #0`; because the kernel is at EL1 and HCR_EL2.TGE=0, that SVC is taken to
// EL1 at VBAR_EL1 + 0x400, where the `__vec_svc` stub (exceptions.rs) saves the frame, checks
// ESR_EL1.EC==0x15 (SVC from AArch64), and calls `aarch64_svc_handler` here — on the faulting task's
// own kernel stack, IRQ-masked. The ABI is the Linux-aarch64 one: x8 = syscall number, args in x0–x5,
// return in x0.
//
// M6b: any OTHER synchronous exception from EL0 (abort/alignment/UNDEF/trapped sysreg) kills the
// task — `aarch64_el0_fault_handler` (exceptions.rs) logs it, records it here (`record_el0_kill`),
// and exits the task; the kernel survives. The user window is permission-split: the CODE page is
// EL0-RX/EL1-RO (flipped by boot::protect_user_code after the blob copy — the kernel's first live
// page-table update), the DATA/STACK pages are EL0-RW and never executable. The M6b demo proves all
// of it with four EL0 programs (one well-behaved — the M6c loaded blob — and three deliberately
// faulting inline fixtures) and a verdict task that demands the EXACT outcome split — see `verdict`
// and main.rs. M6f adds a real copy_from_user and a wider surface.
