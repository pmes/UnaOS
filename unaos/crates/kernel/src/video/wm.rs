//! WC-A — the window table and the compositor.
//!
//! Every EL0 program renders into its OWN off-screen ARGB8888 surface and never touches the real
//! scan-out; the kernel owns the panel. This module is the seam between "a task has a surface" and
//! "pixels reach the HVS": a fixed table of at most [`MAX_WINDOWS`] windows (id, owner ASID,
//! geometry, z-order, surface pointer/stride, damage flag, short title) plus a back-to-front
//! composite pass that blits the damaged windows onto the framebuffer with a per-window integer
//! upscale and kernel-drawn chrome (a 1-px border and a title strip).
//!
//! **Chrome is kernel-drawn, always.** An app draws only inside its own surface; the border and the
//! title strip are painted by the compositor from the kernel's copy of the title. An EL0 program
//! therefore cannot forge another window's frame, and the presentation-modes law ("never fake host
//! chrome") is enforced structurally rather than by convention.
//!
//! **Composite on present, no thread.** [`present`] marks a window damaged and immediately runs the
//! composite pass from the presenting task's own context (the same discipline
//! [`super::screen::present_surface`] has always used: the render task is parked while a full-screen
//! EL0 program owns the panel, so routing through it would present nothing). There is no compositor
//! thread in this arc.
//!
//! **Non-coherent scan-out.** Each composited region is cleaned with `FrameBuffer::flush_range` over
//! the rows it touched, exactly as `Screen::flush` does, so the Pi 4 HVS sees the new pixels.
//!
//! ### Seam for WC-B (the syscall side)
//! `SYS_WIN_CREATE` / `SYS_WIN_PRESENT` / `SYS_WIN_MOVE` / `SYS_WIN_CLOSE` are thin, fail-closed
//! wrappers over [`create`], [`present`], [`move_to`] and [`close`]; per-ASID ownership is checked
//! with [`owner_of`], and task teardown calls [`close_owner`]. Nothing in this module reads task
//! state or touches the syscall layer — the ASID is passed in as an opaque tag.
