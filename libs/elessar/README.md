# ❇️ Elessar: The Lens

**Elessar** is a polymorphic editor for **UnaOS**. Known as the "Vision Stone," it does not merely display files; it transmutes its entire existence to match the substance of the asset it holds. 

In a world of fragmented, single-purpose applications, Elessar is the unified aperture through which one views, shapes, and heals the world.

## 🌈 The Philosophy of Polymorphism

Elessar is not a "text editor." It is a dynamic interface that adapts its state based on the metadata of the target asset. It is a single tool with infinite faces.

### 1. The Transmutation (Adaptive UI)
Elessar shifts its interface to provide the correct tools for the task:
* **Code Mode:** A high-performance, low-latency development environment with deep LSP integration, repo management, etc.
* **CAD Mode:** A 3D-aware spatial interface that translates **Vug** syntheses into structural geometry.
* **NLE Mode (Non-Linear Editor):** A time-bound interface for weaving the grooves of **Stria** media streams.
* **Document Mode:** A minimalist, focused environment for serious writing.

### 2. The Vision Stone (Visual Integrity)
Elessar is built on the belief that the interface should never stand between one and their work.
* **Zero-Friction Transitions:** Shift from editing a configuration file to modifying a 3D component without ever leaving the Lens.
* **Universal Context:** Because Elessar is aware of the **Vairë** workspace, it understands the relationship between your code, your assets, and your history. Have the power of a Valar over your projects.


## 🔮 The Rites (Capabilities)

### 1. INVOKE (Open/Switch)
Elessar does not "load" files; it invokes the correct state for the asset. 
* It queries **Gneiss PAL** for the asset's requirements.
* It realigns its rendering engine (Vulkan/WGPU) to match the required visual fidelity.

### 2. HEAL (Refactor/Repair)
Drawing on the lore of the Elfstone, Elessar includes built-in "healing" protocols for broken logic and fragmented data.
* **Logic Stitching:** Reassembling orphaned code blocks.
* **Structural Alignment:** Ensuring CAD geometry adheres to the **Elemental Forge** tolerances.

### 3. FORGE (Commit/Export)
Elessar interfaces directly with **Vairë** to ensure that once a vision is realized, it is seamlessly archived.
