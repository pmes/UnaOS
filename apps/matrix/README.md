# 🕸️ Matrix: The Grid

**Matrix** is the spatial asset manager of **UnaOS**. It rejects the folder-tree hierarchy of the 1970s (Finder, Explorer). Files do not live in drawers; they live in a web of relationships.

**Matrix** is the graph that connects your data.

## 🌌 The Philosophy: Context over Container

Modern file systems force you to put a file in *one* place. **Matrix** allows a file to exist in *many* contexts simultaneously.

### 1. The Graph (Navigation)
Matrix visualizes your project as a node graph.
*   **The Hub:** A central project node connects to code, assets, docs, and references.
*   **Dynamic Links:** A texture file used in three different 3D models shows lines connecting to all of them. Delete it, and you see exactly what breaks.
*   **Tag-Based Logic:** Folders are just saved search queries (smart collections). "All Rust files modified today" is a view, not a location.

### 2. The Preview (Inspection)
Matrix enables you to preview any file instantly.
*   **3D Rotation:** Spin a `.obj` or `.gltf` model right in the file browser.
*   **Code Peek:** See the first 50 lines of a script without opening an editor.
*   **Media Scrub:** Hover over a video to scrub through it.

## ⚙️ The Mechanics

### The Indexer
Matrix runs a background daemon that indexes metadata, not just filenames.
*   **Content Search:** Find a function definition inside a code file, or a specific hex string inside a binary.
*   **Speed:** Built on the same search technology as **Vein**, results are instant.

### The Workspace
Matrix allows you to save your "mental state."
*   **Session Restore:** When you close a project, Matrix remembers exactly which nodes were expanded and which files were selected.
*   **The Desktop:** Your desktop is just a temporary, visual holding area for active nodes. It is not a folder full of clutter.

## 🛑 The Kill List
Matrix replaces:
*   **macOS Finder / Windows Explorer**
*   **Trello / Jira** (for simple project organization)
*   **Obsidian Graph View** (integrated directly into the file system)
*   **Adobe Bridge**
